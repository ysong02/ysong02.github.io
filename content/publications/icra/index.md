abstract: |
  Remote attestation is a security service to verify and confirm the integrity and trustworthiness of each robot in the swarm. We developed an efficient method of doing remote attestation in parallel with the network access authentication, utilizing a newly standardized key exchange protocol named EDHOC. We demonstrate the feasibility of this method through benchmarks on the hashing time of 520~kB under constrained scenarios, resulting in times of 780ms on the nRF52840 and 728ms on the nRF5340.
