abstract: |
  We propose a lightweight remote attestation protocol designed specifically for resource-constrained IoT devices. The proposed solution enables attestation alongside mutual authentication, while reducing computational and energy costs by utilizing a newly standardized key exchange protocol called EDHOC (Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman Over COSE).
