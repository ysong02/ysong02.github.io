title: IETF 118 at Prague, Czech Republic

event: Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) 118 
event_url: https://www.ietf.org/meeting/past/ 
location: Prague, Czech Republic

summary: First experience participating in the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) community.
abstract: |
  The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) is an open international community of researchers, network operators, and engineers that develops and promotes voluntary Internet standards, particularly those related to the TCP/IP protocol suite. During my first participation in the IETF, I had the opportunity to engage in insightful discussions with security experts and contributors from various working groups.

  These exchanges inspired the idea for a new Internet-Draft within the Lightweight Authenticated Key Exchange (LAKE) working group. The draft explores how to enable remote attestation over the Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman Over COSE (EDHOC) protocol, aiming to provide an efficient and secure attestation mechanism for constrained Internet-of-Things (IoT) environments.
