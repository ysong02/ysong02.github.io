event_url: https://www.ietf.org/meeting/past/ 

location: Madrid, Spain

summary: Presentation in the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) in the Lightweight Authenticated Key Exchange (LAKE) working group.
abstract: |
  The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) is an open international community of researchers, network operators, and engineers that develops and promotes voluntary Internet standards.<br><br>

  During IETF123, I participated the Hackathon during the weekend. During the week, I presented the latest version of the Internet-Draft 'Remote Attestation over EDHOC' (draft-ietf-lake-ra-02) within the Lightweight Authenticated Key Exchange (LAKE) working group. Besides, I also presented the Internet-Draft in the Remote ATtestation ProcedureS (RATS) working group to explore more discussions in the attestation community.<br><br>
  
  The draft explores how to enable remote attestation over the Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman Over COSE (EDHOC) protocol, aiming to provide an efficient and secure attestation mechanism for constrained Internet-of-Things (IoT) environments.
