title: Attested TLS workshop at Linaro Connect 2024

event: Attested Transport Layer Security (TLS) workshop @ Linaro Connect 2024
event_url: https://hackmd.io/@A_TVjSksQxWv7wvs1Ghhiw/r1BdwS3xC 

location: Madrid, Spain

summary: Attended and joined the discussion in attestation community.
abstract: |
  During the Attested TLS workshop, presentations spanned a wide range of use­cases—from 6G mobile network off‐loading to edge and cloud mutual attestation—highlighting the need for TEEs, PSKs, mobile migration support, and lightweight handshake extensions. Implementation‐focused sessions showcased prototypes built on rustls and mbedTLS, exploring performance tradeoffs, background verification models, and DPU/Host attestation ensembles. Sessions on formal modelling and verification revealed the gaps in current attested-TLS specifications and identified critical deliverables for the next milestone. The afternoon hackathon enabled real‐time collaboration across formal verification, specification triage, and implementation tracks. Together, participants laid a foundation for a unified attested TLS ecosystem that spans constrained IoT devices, edge nodes, and cloud services—bridging formal methods, performance engineering, and standardisation.

  This workshop sets the stage for the upcoming milestone of the draft-tls-attestation effort and invites further convergence across SPIFFE, WIMSE, and the TLS Attestation community.
