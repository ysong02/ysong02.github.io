location: Bangkok, Thailand

summary: Presentation in the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) in the Lightweight Authenticated Key Exchange (LAKE) working group.
abstract: |
  The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) is an open international community of researchers, network operators, and engineers that develops and promotes voluntary Internet standards.<br><br>

  During IETF122, I participated the Hackathon during the weekend. During the week, I presented the latest version of the Internet-Draft 'Remote Attestation over EDHOC' (draft-ietf-lake-ra-01) within the Lightweight Authenticated Key Exchange (LAKE) working group. <br><br>

  The Internet-Draft was adopted by the IETF LAKE working group at the beginning of 2025, which indicates that the Internet-Draft transitioned from a individual submission to an officially adopted working group document.
  The draft explores how to enable remote attestation over the Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman Over COSE (EDHOC) protocol, aiming to provide an efficient and secure attestation mechanism for constrained Internet-of-Things (IoT) environments.
