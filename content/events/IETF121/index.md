location: Dublin, Ireland

summary: Presentation in the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) in the Lightweight Authenticated Key Exchange (LAKE) working group.
abstract: |
  The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) is an open international community of researchers, network operators, and engineers that develops and promotes voluntary Internet standards.

  During IETF121, I presented the latest version of the Internet-Draft 'Remote Attestation over EDHOC' (draft-song-lake-ra-02) within the Lightweight Authenticated Key Exchange (LAKE) working group. The draft explores how to enable remote attestation over the Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman Over COSE (EDHOC) protocol, aiming to provide an efficient and secure attestation mechanism for constrained Internet-of-Things (IoT) environments.
