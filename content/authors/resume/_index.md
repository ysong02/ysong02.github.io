I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Information and Communication Technologies with the AIO team at Inria Paris and Sorbonne University, France. I received my M.Sc. and M.Eng. degrees in Telecommunications from INSA Lyon in 2023.

My research lies at the intersection of network security, low-power wireless communications, and Internet-of-Things, with a particular focus on resource-constrained embedded systems and micro-robotics. I am passionate about developing secure and efficient communication protocols for next-generation IoT deployments. As part of my work, I actively contribute to the standardization of attestation protocols for IoT networks at the IETF.

I am fluent in Chinese, English, and French. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss potential collaborations or research opportunities!
